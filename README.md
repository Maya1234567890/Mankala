The zip contains:
client.py - mancala client for competition mode. The program connects with the mancala server & the GUI winform client and runs the game via a strategy bot & board graphics. Runs on python on windows.
MancalaAPI - the GUI winform client. Connects to client.py. Shows graphics of game connection & gameplay updates. Has 4 forms main menu, start game (initialize game), join game and board. Runs on c# windows.
testing.py - a python file which was made for testing the game strategy. We changed the board a lot and built different codes to try and win each time.
Photos - a folder which contains all the images the API uses.
mancala_prs - A presentation about the work we did

To run:
First, the competition mode mancala server needs to be on. then change the IP and the port of the server in the client.py file accordingly. Secondly, run the client.py file. For the finale step run the MancalaAPI code.
